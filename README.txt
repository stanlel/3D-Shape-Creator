Programming Assignment from a computer graphics class that is an extension of the 2D shape creator that now takes in input of an OBJ, makes it viewable, and allows transformations. (Needs to be reimplemented, a lot of bugs and needs to do proper matrix transformation instead of modification of verticies)



(l) - Sets Line mode
(t) - Sets Triangle mode
(r) - Sets Rectangle mode
(e) - Sets Ellipsis mode

(d) - clears screen (may need multiple clears)


------
Run OBJ file...

1. Make file 
2. ./assn1 <insert obj file>


WASD - transformation keys

(R) - Rotate OBJ
(S) - Scale OBJ
(T) - Transform OBJ
